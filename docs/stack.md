- **Frontend: React.js (with JavaScript)**
This framework is great for building interactive UIs, like game boards, player dashboards, and turn notifications. It's component-based, so you can create reusable pieces (e.g., a "unit" component). Pair it with HTML5 Canvas or a library like Phaser.js for rendering maps and graphics. Why React? It's popular for web games, has tons of tutorials, and integrates easily with backends. If you want something lighter, vanilla JavaScript with HTML/CSS works, but React speeds up development for complex interfaces.
- **Backend: Python with FastAPI**
FastAPI is a modern, efficient framework for building APIs—perfect for your game's server needs, like processing turns, validating moves, and syncing data between players. It's async-friendly for handling multiple users and uses Python's type hints, which you'll appreciate from your class design experience. Alternatives like Flask are simpler if you want minimalism, but FastAPI is faster and more scalable for games. You can run game logic here, using libraries like Pydantic for data validation.
- **Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB**
Store game data (e.g., player progress, board states) in PostgreSQL for structured data—it's reliable and works well with Python via libraries like SQLAlchemy. If your game has more flexible data (like JSON-like maps), MongoDB is easier and pairs nicely with JavaScript.
- **Deployment and Extras**:
Host the frontend on something like Vercel or Netlify (free tiers available). For the backend, use Heroku or Render. To enable multiplayer without real-time demands (since it's turn-based), use REST APIs for communication—players can refresh or poll for updates. If you add notifications, integrate WebSockets via FastAPI's built-in support.
